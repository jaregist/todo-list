# todo-list

JavaScript Practice -- followed tutorial for this to-do list and made some changes after finishing.

To-Do List allows you to add things to the list, mark them as complete, and delete them. 

The app will save your list locally so you can open and close the browser and it will maintain your "to-dos".
